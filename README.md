# Rest Countries API Flag Descriptions

This repository contains the files used to add flag descriptions to the REST Countries API.

These include:

- The flag descriptions json file
- The initial python script used to add a flag description field to the API
- The final python script used to modify the API's flag field to include an alt field based on feedback from the API maintainer

The [REST Countries API repository](https://gitlab.com/restcountries/restcountries) is hosted on GitLab.
